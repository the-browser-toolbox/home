# The Browser Toolbox
Browser extensnions are very powerful tools to enhance browsing experience. Most of the modern-day browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera use add-ons and extensions to add functionality to existing ones. The documentation for these extensions is very well-maintained and is huge.

Many of the projects in GSoC involve converting existing standalone applications into browser extensions. So, the projects will give a heads-up and an initial boost to the journey of students towards GSoC.

The aim of the organisation is to introduce the power of browser APIs to begineers to code, as well as to enhance the browsing experience of the end-user. Firstly, small scale and beginner-friendly extensions will be developed, and then they will be merged into one cross-platform extension.
